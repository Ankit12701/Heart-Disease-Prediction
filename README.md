# Heart-Disease-Prediction

# Here I have used Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person has any heart disese or not based on various features.

## The datset used here have the following columns namely:-
   
  # 1:- age -   age in years
   
  # 2:- sex -   1 for male and 0 for female
   
  # 3:- cp  -   chest pain type
   
  # 4:- trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
   
  #  5:- chol   - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
   
  # 6:- fbs -  (fasting blood sugar &gt; 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
   
  # 7:- restecg  - resting electrocardiographic results
   
  # 8:- thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
   
  # 9:- exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
   
  # 10:- oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

  # 11:- slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
   
  # 12:- ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
   
  # 13:- thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
   
  # 14:- target - 1 or 0   where   1-  defective heart   and 0- healthy heart
